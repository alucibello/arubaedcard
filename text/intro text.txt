The Aruban Government welcomes you and your family to Aruba.

The online Embarkation/ Disembarkation (ED) card is a pre-registration form required to enter Aruba. As per the country's immigration policy, all incoming tourists must fully complete the online ED card application. It's an essential entry requirement that you can complete quickly and easily online. Simply enter your details into the relevant fields, and upon a successful submission you'll receive an affirmation by email. A passenger that claims to be exempted from completion of the ED Card application due to citizenship, must provide basic information to confirm his status. Pursuant to his status he will receive a confirmation by email.

What you'll need:
A valid passport
Personal details
Contact information
Travel information
A valid credit card (Visa, Mastercard or Discover)

What you should note:
The online ED card is not a visa.
The successful submission of your online ED card does not guarantee entry into Aruba. On arrival to Aruba, your eligibility for entry will be assessed on its own merits. It is crucial that all information you provide, or on your behalf by a designated third party, must be true and correct, as this is a key factor in your entry assessment.
